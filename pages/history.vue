            After a full year, I get an idea for writing a blog post on <NuxtLink to="/blog/2023-06-27-global-allocators">custom global allocators in Rust</NuxtLink>.
            In that time, I gained a lot of experience in writing websites with <NuxtLink to="https://nuxt.com">Nuxt</NuxtLink>.
            I take this oppurtunity to completely rewrite the website using it and the <NuxtLink to="https://content.nuxtjs.org">Content module</NuxtLink>.

        <HistoryEntry date="May 10, 2022">
            I publish my final blog post using Jekyll about <i>Shared-State Functions in Python</i>.
            It was a fun post about using Python function arguments incorrectly.
            What follows this is a 1 year silence where I do not post anything.

            Rewrote the website using Jekyll, Github Page's preferred website generator.
            I used a custom theme named <NuxtLink to="https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk">Moonwalk</NuxtLink>. I really liked how it looked!
            My first blog post stated that this was the 4th version of my blog to be published.

        <HistoryEntry date="August 19, 2021">
            Rewrote the website using <NuxtLink to="https://gohugo.io">Hugo CMS</NuxtLink>, under the domain <i>bd103.thedev.id</i>.
            This domain was shortly changed to <i>bd103.github.io</i> due to issues using the <code>CNAME</code> file.
            All code for my previous website was moved to <NuxtLink to="https://github.com/BD103/Old-Website">BD103/Old-Website</NuxtLink> and <NuxtLink to="https://github.com/BD103/Old-Website-2">BD103/Old-Website-2</NuxtLink>.
