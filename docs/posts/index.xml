      <description>Hello, and welcome to my new website / blog!
Why did you change? I (drastically) changed my website for a number of reasons.
 My old website had a weird style and never got updated I wanted a blog that I could actually use I saw Hugo used by a number of websites and got inspired  What will this mean for the future? Look forward to new posts and updates :)</description>
