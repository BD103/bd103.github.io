Hello, and welcome to my new website / blog!

Now you may be thinking: _hm, I'm getting deja vu_. Correct! This is currently the 4th rendition of my blog.

Let's take a trip back in time...

1. [Boom! First commit!](https://github.com/BD103/Old-Website/commit/cc27800e58f0a882a8620f771033b9204751fe84) My website, hosted at bd103.github.io is up and running. (You can still find the code [here](https://github.com/BD103/Old-Website))
2. My website was slow. Really slow, so I decided to speed things up. [Bam, a static HTML website](https://github.com/BD103/Old-Website-2). It had a nice minimalistic feel, but wasn't stylish and needed to by manually updated
3. I find a blog made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so I try it out. It went decently, but I didn't know what I was doing. This website looked the cleanest of the past 3, but it also didn't have a lot of features
4. [Here we are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y49b8aiQVBg), at the present day. I decided finally that, since Jekyll default supported for Github Pages, I would use that instead. That's about it for now.

**so yeah**
