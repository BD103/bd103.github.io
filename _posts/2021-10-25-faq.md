Hi! I have been getting a lot of questions recently, so I have decided to post a FAQ about myself. Enjoy:

- How can I contact you?
  - I have a special [repo](https://github.com/BD103/BD103) where you can ask me questions (through the "Issues" tab)
- What is your favorite programming language?
  - Right now it is Python 3! I'm really getting into threading and advanced [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask-sqlalchemy) applications
- Can we do a collab project?
  - All I can really say is _maybe_. I find it hard to stay motivated on a project that I'm not really excited about. If you have an idea, I can see what I can do. Just as a warning, though: I'm not very good with collab projects, most of ones I've done haven't gone anywhere.
- So I guess that means I shouldn't ask you...
  - No! It is perfectly fine to ask, just be ok with the chance of me saying no. I'll try my best to make it work, though!
- What's the difference between [BD103-Python](https://github.com/BD103/BD103-Python), [BD103](https://pypi.org/project/bd103/), and [BD103-Java](https://github.com/BD103/BD103-Java)?
  - BD103-Python is supposed to be a set of global utilities that I use in my projects. BD103 on PyPI is the namespace that it uses. BD103-Java is a port of BD103-Python for Java. They are supposed to mirror functionality, but I'm still working on all the bits and pieces.
- It seems that you've gone silent! Has anything happened?
  - Most likely not. I've probably just been working on private projects!
- What is "Make it better?"
  - [...](https://github.com/whippingdot/personal-website/pull/2)

If you have any more questions, read the first response lol. Cya,
